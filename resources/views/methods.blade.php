<h2>Choose your method</h2>

<p>We will form groups sizing about 4-6 people, but you will personally choose from your own wants and needs. Four different ways to present the data is listed below, but if you can come up with a fifth that gets the teachers approval, you can explore that track.</p>

<h3>Map it out</h3>
<p>Use mapbox or similar service to present the data. You will probably convert or process the data to make it fit into the GeoJson dataset format.</p>

<h3>Graphical representation</h3>
<p>Use your knowledge in CSS and JS to create some info-graphic-stylish solution, in line with Flows in the River Murray System or in the form of a timeline/roadmap as the history of RAM or how about some business-style infographics?</p>

<h3>Focus on history</h3>
<p>Use the data to explore a week, a month, a year at the measurestations. Let the user filter, sort, choose different aspects of flow and levels of water. Here you could probably do with some framework like Chart.js or the heavier d3</p>

<h3>Go for the win</h3>
<p>Challenge yourself into doing a quiz or a simple game from the data. This is very challenging as the data in itself doesn't hold very much information. Also, the data is not expected to change rapidly, so don't try to make a quick guessing game of the water level at Gårda dämme. But if you have an idea, try it!</p>
